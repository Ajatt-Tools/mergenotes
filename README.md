Suppose you have a subs2srs deck.
Due to the way subs2srs works usually many sentences in the deck are split between multiple notes.
This addon adds a button to the Anki Browser that allows you to merge contents of selected cards.

I recommend converting all notes to one `note type` before merging them.
The add-on will ignore the fields that are present in one note but are not present in the other.

## Features

0) **Merge** or **duplicate** selected notes.
1) Change settings before merging.
To open quick settings, click "Edit" > "Merge Fields Settings" in the Anki Browser.
2) Ability to specify a field separator.
You can decide what string is inserted as a separator between the merged fields.
3) Merge tags of selected cards.
4) Delete original notes after merging.
5) Choose direction of the merge: by `Due` number, by `Sort Field` or by `Sort Field (numeric)`.
The latter checks if there's a number in the field and sorts by the number first.
6) Merge in reverse order.
7) Skip non-empty fields to perform a partial merge.
8) Merge duplicate notes.
Go to "Browser" > "Notes" > "Find duplicates",
search duplicates and click "Merge duplicates" after the search has finished.

## Installation

The addon can be installed from [Ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1425504015), or manually:
```
git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mergenotes.git' ~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/mergenotes
```

## Configuration

To configure the add-on, open the Anki Add-on Menu
via "Tools" > "Add-ons" and select "mergenotes".
Then click the "Config" button on the right-side of the screen.

Most of the settings can be accessed by opening the Anki Browser
and selecting "Edit" > "Merge Fields Settings...".
Before merging duplicates, I recommend enabling the "Delete original notes" option.

Field separator is the string inserted between the merged fields.
It is empty by default, but you can change it to a space, comma or any HTML tag like `<br>`.
You can also use escaped characters like "\n" or "\t" to insert a linebreak or tab.
